Chapter 6 exercise 6
You run the following code...

    names = ['bob', 'joe', 'susan', 'margaret']
    names['margaret'] = 'jody'
    
...and get the following error message:

TypeError: no implicit conversion of String into Integer
  from (irb):2:in `[]='
  from (irb):2
  from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-p353/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'
  
What is the problem and how can it be fixed?

names['margaret'] doesn't refer to a member of the names array. 'margaret' is 
not an index. names.index('margaret') will return the index of the first 
instance of 'margaret' in the array, so one way to fix this would be

    names[names.index('margaret')] = "jody"

or

    names[names.find_index('margaret')] = "jody"
    
Of course, if you know the index of 'margaret' in the array you could always 
just code

    names[3] = 'jody'
