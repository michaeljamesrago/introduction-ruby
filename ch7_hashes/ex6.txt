Chapter 7 exercise 6
Given the following code...

    x = "hi there"
    my_hash = {x: "some value"}
    my_hash2 = {x => "some value"}

What's the difference between the two hashes that were created?

A: In my_hash, the key is a symbol. In my_hash2, the key is the variable x which
evaluates to the string "hi there".
