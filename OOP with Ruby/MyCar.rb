#Create a class called MyCar. When you initialize a new instance or object of
#the class, allow the user to define some instance variables that tell us the
#year, color, and model of the car. Create an instance variable that is set to
#0 during instantiation of the object to track the current speed of the car as
#well. Create instance methods that allow the car to speed up, brake, and shut
#the car off.
